Provides a hierarchical inheritance-based library of 
network packet types and protocols.
<p>
On an ethernet network, data is nested and encapsulated in headers.
For example, an ethernet link-level header might encapsulate an 
IP or ARP header. An IP header can encapsulate a UDP datagram
which contains a DNS protocol message.
<p>
In this package, the relationships between these packet types 
are expressed via inheritance and the individual packet classes 
encapsulate the details of each specific protocol.
<p>
The class PacketFactory converts raw byte data into packet instances.
<p>
Other utility classes in this package provide store the many port numbers,
message types and codes associated with different protocols.
